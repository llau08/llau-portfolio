      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I made a career pivot after spending 5 years as an Insurance Broker. One
        of my best friends had introduced me to coding and I enjoyed it
        instantly. I love it for the challenge it brings and the creativity
        surrounding it. I'm not someone who has a university degree, however I
        am a proud BrainStation bootcamp graduate that strives to learn and
        showcase my best work always. My hobbies when I'm not practicing code
        include watching movies/shows, playing video games, and hanging out with
        my friends.
